### Howdy!

I’m Matthias, an independent software engineer focused on cloud-native applications and APIs. I care deeply about software quality and have hands-on experience analyzing and modernizing legacy systems in cloud transformation projects.

With 23+ years in C# building enterprise software for Windows, Linux, and the cloud, I’ve since expanded my toolset—today I primarily work with Go and Rust, choosing the best language for the problem rather than forcing a favorite.

This GitHub hosts a mix of personal projects, collaborations, and forks of projects I learned from. Have a look around, and reach out if you’re interested in collaborating or exchanging ideas.
