### Howdy!

I'm Matthias, an independent developer with a multifaceted interest in software engineering who is passionate about developing cloud-native apps and APIs. I strongly focus on software quality and have experience in risk analysis of legacy software solutions in modernization and cloud transformation projects.

I am a C# developer with more than 22+ years of experience developing enterprise solutions targeting Windows Server, Linux, and the cloud. Today, I still build in C#, but I have added Golang and Rust to my portfolio and use what is most suitable for solving a problem.
